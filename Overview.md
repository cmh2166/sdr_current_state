# SDR Ecosystem Overview

This is a high level overview that will be worked on and added to as we move through the work plan.

# Proposed Outcomes of this Work

1. Dataflow diagrams for shared understanding.
2. Dataflow 'specs' for details useful for data processing, development, dev-ops, or operational concerns about codebases or system-wide / integration-level work.
3. All the updated / gathered ops & dev-ops info being put into devopsdocs or elsewhere.
4. List and details of interfaces and data QA points we want to log / monitor better.
5. Identifying key components we can more readily move to ETL pipelines across applications.
6. Continuing to build out https://github.com/sul-dlss/docker-sdr based on the interfaces weâ€™re identifying.
7. Understanding what exists for shifting in part to a digital repository system framework and architecture.
