# SDR Current State Working Group

## Scope

This is a working group to explore, explain, document, and improve shared understanding of the current state of SDR (SDR2). It aims to generate documentation that explains for end-to-end workflows for SDR resources, and then expand out from that to understand the implicated:
- codebases & applications
- application interfaces
- data stores
- machines/servers
- scripts
- data / objects
- analytics (monitoring, testing, etc.)
- etc.

The goal of this group is not to propose changes to SDR, but to just uncover, understand, and document what currently exists for the sake of common understanding across units and projects. The proposed artifact(s) would be documentation, diagrams, and meeting(s) with units in DLSS to review and disseminate the findings.

## Definitions

## Conveners:

* Christina, Chris, Erin?

## Participants

We need a core set of people at each meeting, then we want to request additional participants as we cover SDR infrastructure portions that relate to their expertise (see the proposed [work plan](WORKPLAN.md) with sections and folks to bring in).

We need to balance being able to move through the infrastructure understanding relatively quickly while not losing details needed to understand our current infrastructure.

Core Group:
- Chris Beer
- Erin Fahy
- Tony Zanella
- Christina Harlow
- Ben? Lynn? Infrastructure team??

## General Timeframe

This group wants to work relatively quickly to get through a "first pass" of understanding the current state of the SDR infrastructure that can then be used to help guide a number of other projects and efforts. We propose to get through a first pass of the outlined SDR ecosystem within 2-3 months, with a [(open to shifting) work plan outlined here](WORKPLAN.md).

## Workspace, Meetings, & Communication

### Primary Workspace (Notes, Outputs):

- This GitHub repository. We'll keep docs, diagrams, other artifacts in the repository until we're finished (then they'll be migrated somewhere better), and meeting notes / calendar / etc. in the GitHub wiki.

### Communication:

- [Weekly, 1 Hour Meetings per this schedule](WORKPLAN.md)
- Github Issues on this repository for work-specific discussions or questions
- Github Projects on this repository for work management
- SUL-DLSS Slack channel?
