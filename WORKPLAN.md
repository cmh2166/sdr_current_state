# SDR Current State Working Group Work Plan
### Summer 2017

The SDR & DOR ecosystem groupings are largely artificial, for the sake of planning work, and can probably be contested in other contexts.

Note: this will change as needed, and we will keep this plan up to date with the current status.

## Work Plan

Work through the following groupings with these questions in mind:
- in an end-to-end workflow, what object(s) are consumed, what object(s) are produced, and which applications are involved?
- what logging, profiling, or object QA validation checks exist for this segment of the process?
- enumerate the interfaces and connecting processes

1. Object Current State stats: Christina, Tony
    a. DOR Fedora 3
    b. Pres-Core filesystem
    c. Argo Index
    d. SURI identifiers numbers
    e. PURL-fetcher output
2. Ingest / Entry Points: Ben, Peter, Atz, Naomi
    a. Hydrus &/or ETDs
    b. Pre-assembly (what uses pre-assembly scripts?)
    c. WAS (was-registrar)
    d. Staging file systems?
3. DOR Assembly & Accessioning: Chris,
    a. DOR Services (Gem)
    b. DOR Services (App)
    c. SURI

6. Preservation Core: Darren W., Ben?

## Back-lot Ideas or Questions

Back-lot of ideas raised for work steps/output, kept for future referral:

- "scriptware"?
- IIIF publishing relationships to SDR ecosystem
- Spotlight inclusion? Out of scope for this?
