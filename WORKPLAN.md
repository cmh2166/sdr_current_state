# SDR Current State Working Group Work Plan
### Summer 2017

The SDR & DOR ecosystem groupings are largely artificial, for the sake of planning work, and can probably be contested in other contexts.

Note: this will change as needed, and we will keep this plan up to date with the current status.

## SDR Ecosystem Overview Groupings

Working folder (has many diagrams and notes in progress): https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/0B74oOQcTdnHjSk4wSS0yWFJLRWs?usp=sharing

## Proposed Outcomes of this Work

1. Dataflow & data model diagrams for shared understanding.
2. Dataflow & data model 'specs' for details useful for data processing, development, dev-ops, or operational concerns about codebases or system-wide / integration-level work.
3. All the updated / gathered ops & dev-ops info being put into devopsdocs or another appropriate identified place.
4. List and details of interfaces and data assessment points we want to log / monitor better.
5. Identifying key components we can more readily move to data pipelines architecture (including ETL processing) across applications.
6. Continuing to build out https://github.com/sul-dlss/docker-sdr based on the interfaces weâ€™re identifying for better application development integration testing.
7. Improved documentation generation for dataflows by development teams.
8. Patch party and possible work cycles for cleaning up & adding better logging, monitoring, analytics & report generation for SDR, based off the findings of this work.

## Work Plan

Work through the following groupings with these questions in mind:
- in an end-to-end workflow, what object(s) are consumed, what object(s) are produced, and which applications are involved?
- what logging, profiling, or object QA validation checks exist for this segment of the process?
- enumerate the interfaces and connecting processes

## Back-lot Ideas or Questions

Back-lot of ideas raised for work steps/output, kept for future referral:

- "scriptware"?
- IIIF publishing relationships to SDR ecosystem
- Spotlight inclusion? Out of scope for this?
